Test Driven Development (TDD) involves writing tests before the code is written. 
The tests are written so that the subsequent code must be written correctly to pass it with the intended consequences.

Unit testing involves testing down to the smallest individual components of a frontend app, feature, or function.

Unit TDD ensures that, if the smallest components pass the tests, then the aggregation of tested components should also perform.
